# SDGAN
 SDGAN: Tuning Stable Diffusion with an adversarial network

This is a research project aimed at enhancing Stable Diffusion with GAN training for better perceptual detail. Currently, no pretrained model weights are available. Things are still in flux and the model may change in ways that are not backwards compatible with trained weights. Use at your own risk.

TODO
* ☐ Investigate using different samples for generator and discriminator training
* ☐ Test the effect of adding self-attention to all layers
* ☐ Test the effect of different parameter initializations
* ☐ Investigate using cross attention
